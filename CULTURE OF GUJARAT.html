The folk traditions of Gujarat include bhavai and raas-garba. Bhavai is a folk theatre; it is partly entertainment and partly ritual, and is dedicated to Amba. 
The raas-garba is a folk dance done as a celebration of Navratri by Gujarati people. 
The folk costume of this dance is chaniya choli for women and kedia for men.
 Different styles and steps of garba include dodhiyu, simple five, simple seven, popatiyu, trikoniya,
 lehree, tran taali, butterfly, hudo, two claps and many more. 
 Sheri garba is one of the oldest form of garba where all the women wear red patola sari and sing along while dancing. 
 It is a very graceful form of garba. Makar Sankranti is a festival where people of Gujarat fly kites.
 In Gujarat, from December through to Makar Sankranti, people start enjoying kite flying. Undhiyu, a special dish made of various vegetables,
 is a must-have of Gujarati people on Makar Sankranti.
 Surat is especially well known for the strong string which is made by applying glass powder on the row thread to provide it a cutting edge.

 The four major regions of Gujarat all bring their own styles to Gujarati food. Many Gujarati dishes are distinctively sweet, salty, and spicy at the same time.
 In Saurashtra region, chhash (buttermilk) is believed to be a must-have in their daily food.
