<H4><P><CENTER>The Government of Gujarat, also known as the State Government of Gujarat, or locally as State Government, 
<BR>is the supreme governing authority of the Indian state of Gujarat and its 33 districts. It consists of an executive
 <BR>of the legislators appointed by the Governor of Gujarat, a judiciary and of a publicly electedlegislative body.
<BR>Like other states in India, the head of state of Gujarat is the Governor, appointed by the President of India on the advice
 <BR>of the Central (Union) government. His or her post is largely ceremonial, but considers the legislative composition and 
 <BR>appoints the Chief Minister, who is the main head of government, as chair of the 
<BR>Council of Ministers of Gujarat and is vested, in some instances alone but as to most executive powers by Council 
<BR>consensus with virtually all of the executive powers.
<BR>Gandhinagar, the capital of Gujarat, houses the relevant Vidhan Sabha (also known as the Gujarat Legislative Assembly) 
<BR>and the secretariat. The Gujarat High 
<BR>Court in Ahmedabad, has jurisdiction over the state as to state laws.

<BR>The present legislative assembly is unicameral, consisting of 182 Members of the Legislative Assembly (M.L.As).
 <BR>Its term is 5 years, unless sooner dissolved.</CENTER></P></H4>
