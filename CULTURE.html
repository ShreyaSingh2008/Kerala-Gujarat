 It is a synthesis of Aryan, Dravidian, Arab, and European cultures,developed over millennia, under influences from other parts of India and abroad.
 It is defined by its antiquity and the organic continuity sustained by the Malayali people.
 It was elaborated through centuries of contact with neighbouring and overseas cultures.
 However, the geographical insularity of Kerala from the rest of the country has resulted in the development of a distinctive lifestyle, art, architecture, language, literature and social institutions.
 Over 10,000 festivals are celebrated in the state every year.
 The Malayalam calendar, a solar sidereal calendar started from 825 CE in Kerala,
 finds common usage in planning agricultural and religious activities.
 Malayalam, one of the classical languages in India, is Kerala's official language. 
 Over a dozen other scheduled and unscheduled languages are also spoken.
 Kerala has the greatest consumption of alcohol in India.

Many of the temples in Kerala hold festivals on specific days of the year.
A common characteristic of these festivals is the hoisting of a holy flag which is brought down on the final day of the festival after immersing the deity.
 Some festivals include Poorams, the best known of these being the Thrissur Pooram.
 "Elephants, firework displays and huge crowds" are the major attractions of Thrissur Pooram.
 Other known festivals are Makaravilakku,Chinakkathoor Pooram, Attukal Pongala and Nenmara Vallangi Vela .
 Temples that can't afford it will usually involve at least one richly caparisoned elephant as part of the festivities. 
 When the procession visits homes around the temple, people will usually present rice, coconuts, and other offerings to it.
 Processions often include traditional music such as Panchari melam or Panchavadyam.
